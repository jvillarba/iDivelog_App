## WDI_SM_21 Project Two
## ONLINE SCUBA DIVELOG

** This app will allow users to log their scuba dives with an online file system **

* Users must log in with email and password to add users & dives

* Guests can add dive sites (location name and city)

* Divers will know how many dives they have as well as the maximum depth reached

* Individual dive information provides:
  1. location/dive site
  2. date/time of diver
  3. maximum depth of dive
  4. air used / nitrox mix
  5. temperature
  6. amount of weights used
  7. dive computer reference


### User Stores:

As a diver, I want to be able to log my dives and retain the dive information in one place.

As a diver, I want to be add the different sites and add photos to recall the underwater and above water experience.

### Future Implementation:

* Being able to sort the dive sites alphabetically, determine maximum depth reached
* Ability to add comments on dives
* The ability to upload photos of fish taken at dive sites

### Technologies / Frameworks:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby 2.2.1
* Rails
* Bootstrap
* Heroku/AWS

The following drafts are ERBs of my online SCUBA divelog.
